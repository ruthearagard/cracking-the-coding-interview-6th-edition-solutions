Language of Choice
------------------------
  
I chose to use the C language targeting the [ISO/IEC 9899:2018 (C18)](https://www.iso.org/standard/74528.html) standard, without compiler extensions or nonstandard functions. This is because it essentially forces me to come up with as much code on my own as possible without relying on standard library facilities which, while convenient and would surely save time, will not prove much of anything.
